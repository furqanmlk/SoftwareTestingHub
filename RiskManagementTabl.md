# Risk Management Table

| **Risk**                     | **Impact**                                | **Mitigation**                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tight deadlines**          | Insufficient test coverage               | Prioritize high-risk areas first                   |
| **Third-party API downtime** | Blocking test execution                   | Mock API responses for testing                    |
| **Flaky UI automation**      | False negatives in test results           | Implement retry logic and stable selectors        |
| **Unstable test environment** | Frequent test failures, inconsistent results | Use containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes) |
| **High defect leakage**      | Production issues, customer dissatisfaction | Implement stricter exit criteria before release   |
| **Insufficient test data**   | Test cases fail due to missing dependencies | Generate synthetic data or use data masking       |
| **Limited test automation**  | Increased manual effort, slower execution | Increase automation for repetitive test cases     |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Risk of data breaches                     | Conduct security testing (SQL injection, XSS, OWASP ZAP) |
| **Performance degradation**  | Slow response times under high load       | Conduct performance/load testing with JMeter/k6   |
| **Lack of skilled testers**  | Lower test quality                        | Provide training, mentorship, and knowledge-sharing sessions |
| **Changing requirements**    | Frequent test script modifications        | Adopt an Agile approach with flexible test plans  |
| **Cross-browser compatibility issues** | UI inconsistencies in different browsers | Use BrowserStack/SauceLabs for compatibility testing |
| **Delayed bug fixes**        | Slower test execution and retesting       | Collaborate with developers and implement CI/CD pipelines |
| **Inconsistent test environments** | Test failures due to different configurations | Standardize environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) |
| **Data integrity issues**    | Mismatched records, inconsistent results  | Validate database consistency with SQL queries   |
