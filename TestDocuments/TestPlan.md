# Test Plan

## 1. Test Plan Overview
This document outlines the test plan for the new software release to ensure that all functionalities work as expected, meet the requirements, and are free from major defects.

## 2. Objectives
- Validate that the new release meets business and technical requirements.
- Ensure that no existing functionality is broken.
- Identify and report defects before deployment.
- Validate performance, security, and usability aspects of the system.

## 3. Test Scope
### In Scope
- New features and enhancements as per the release notes.
- Regression testing for existing features.
- Performance, security, and usability testing.
- Integration testing with external systems.

### Out of Scope
- Deprecated or unsupported features.
- Non-production environments beyond staging.

## 4. Test Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows 11, macOS, Linux
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- **Test Tools:** Selenium, JIRA, Postman, JMeter
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins

## 5. Test Strategy
### A. Smoke Testing
- Verify basic functionality before proceeding with deeper testing.
- **Example:** Check if the login page loads successfully.

### B. Functional Testing
- Validate new and existing features based on test cases.
- **Example:** Verify that users can reset their password via email verification.

### C. Regression Testing
- Ensure existing functionalities are not broken.
- **Example:** Run automated test cases to validate old features still work.

### D. Performance Testing
- Evaluate response times and system stability under load.
- **Example:** Simulate 1,000 concurrent users to check application performance.

### E. Security Testing
- Identify vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Example:** Test SQL injection and XSS attacks.

### F. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Validate usability and compliance with business requirements.
- **Example:** Conduct a UAT session with end-users for feedback.

- Bugs will be categorized based on severity: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**.
- Fixes will be verified before marking issues as resolved.

## 8. Test Deliverables
- Test Plan Document
- Test Cases & Test Scripts
- Test Execution Reports
- Defect Reports
- Final Test Summary Report

## 9. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk                        | Mitigation Strategy                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Delayed test environment    | Use cloud-based environments as backup   |
| Last-minute requirement changes | Agile sprint planning & impact analysis |
| Insufficient test data      | Use test data generation tools           |

## 10. Approval & Sign-Off
- Test execution must be signed off by QA Lead & Product Owner before deployment.
