# Using Machine Learning & Heuristics to Detect Flaky Tests

## 1. Understanding Flaky Tests
A **flaky test** is one that produces **inconsistent results**â€”it passes sometimes and fails other times **without code changes**. The most common causes include:

- **Timeouts** (e.g., elements not loading in time)
- **Dynamic Elements** (e.g., changing IDs, lazy-loaded components)
- **Race Conditions** (e.g., waiting for elements that are not fully rendered)
- **Third-party dependencies** (e.g., API delays, network instability)

---

## 2. Using Heuristics to Identify Flakiness
A **heuristic approach** is a **rule-based method** that detects flaky tests without using ML.

### âœ… Common Heuristic Rules
| **Rule** | **Explanation** | **Detection Method** |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Execution Time Variability** | If a testâ€™s runtime fluctuates significantly, it may indicate **dynamic waiting issues**. | Track test execution time and flag tests with **high variance**. |
| **Element Not Found Errors** | Tests that fail due to `ElementNotFound` may indicate **race conditions or dynamic locators**. | Analyze logs and count occurrences of `NoSuchElementException` or `TimeoutException`. |
| **Retries Leading to Success** | If a test fails initially but **passes on retry**, it suggests **flakiness**. | Track test retries and analyze success patterns. |
| **Network Request Delays** | API-based tests failing intermittently may indicate **network delays**. | Log response times and correlate failures with **slow responses**. |

### ðŸ”¹ **Implementation Example**
- Run **historical test data analysis** from a test execution tool (e.g., Cypress Dashboard, Playwright Trace Viewer, Selenium Logs).
- Set a **threshold**: If a test fails **â‰¥30% of the time in the last 50 runs**, flag it as flaky.
- Automate this by writing a script to **track failures per test ID** and **log the error patterns**.

## 3. Using Machine Learning Models to Detect Flakiness
Instead of relying on static rules, **machine learning models** can learn patterns from **historical test executions** and predict **flaky test behavior**.

### âœ… ML Approach to Flaky Test Detection

### **Step 1: Collect Data**
Gather test execution logs from **past runs**, including:
- **Test ID**
- **Pass/Fail Outcome**
- **Execution Time**
- **Number of Retries**
- **Error Messages**
- **Screenshot Differences (for visual tests)**
- **Network Response Time**
- **CPU/Memory Usage During Test Execution**

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
Convert raw data into meaningful **features** for ML:

| **Feature Name** | **Description** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `failure_rate`  | Percentage of test failures over last `N` runs. |
| `retry_count`   | Number of times test passed after retry. |
| `avg_exec_time` | Average time taken by test. |
| `time_variance` | Fluctuations in execution time. |
| `network_latency` | API response time variance. |
| `element_not_found_count` | Count of `NoSuchElementException` occurrences. |

### **Step 3: Choose a Machine Learning Model**
The following models can help detect flaky tests:

| **Model** | **Best Use Case** |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Decision Trees** | Simple rule-based classification (e.g., flaky vs. stable). |
| **Random Forests** | Better at handling noisy data and multiple failure causes. |
| **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)** | Best for learning complex patterns. |
| **Neural Networks** | Used when analyzing **large test datasets**. |

### **Step 4: Train & Evaluate the Model**
- **Split the data** into training (80%) and testing (20%).
- Train the model on **past flaky vs. stable tests**.
- Evaluate using **Precision/Recall scores** (how well the model predicts flaky tests).

## 4. Real-World Example: Using ML to Detect Flaky Tests
A **basic implementation** using Python + Scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load test execution data
data = pd.read_csv("test_execution_logs.csv")

# Define features and target
X = data[['failure_rate', 'retry_count', 'avg_exec_time', 'time_variance', 'network_latency']]
y = data['is_flaky']  # 1 for flaky, 0 for stable

# Split data into training/testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict flakiness
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
