### ✅ Task Prioritization Strategy (Manual QA – Tight Deadlines)

| 🔢 Priority | 🎯 Criteria                          | 🚀 Action |
|------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| 🔴 High     | 🔧 Core features, business-critical flows | Execute first – highest risk if broken |
| 🔴 High     | 🧬 Recent code changes                  | Focus here – more prone to new bugs |
| 🟡 Medium   | 🔗 Integration points                  | Validate data flow between modules |
| 🟡 Medium   | 🔁 Key regression areas               | Run selected regression cases |
| 🟢 Low      | 📦 Low-impact features                | Defer or document for later |
| ⏱️ All      | ⏲️ Very limited time                  | Run smoke tests + exploratory testing |
| 🤝 All      | 👥 Cross-team alignment               | Communicate with Dev/Product for scope |
| 📝 All      | 🗂️ Track coverage                     | Document tested vs. skipped areas |
