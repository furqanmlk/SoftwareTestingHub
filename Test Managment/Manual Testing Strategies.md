# QA Manual Interview Preparation - Furqan Malik

## Question 1: Tell me about yourself

**Answer:**

I’m a seasoned QA professional with over 15 years of experience in both manual and automation testing. Most recently at McAfee, I led test efforts across three agile teams—one backend and two frontend—each with around six members. I collaborated closely with UI developers, DevOps, backend engineers, and product managers to define test plans, ensure coverage, and improve the quality of web and API services. I’ve built automation frameworks using Playwright, Cypress, and Python, and helped increase our test automation coverage by 30%. My strengths lie in catching issues early, enhancing test processes, and delivering reliable releases under tight timelines.

**STAR Format:**

| Situation | Task | Action | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| McAfee Canada – Sr. Software Automation Developer | Lead QA efforts across backend and frontend teams | Collaborated with developers, PMs, and DevOps; built test plans; created automation frameworks | 30% boost in coverage, 40% regression time reduction, strong cross-team coordination |

## Question 2: Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it

**Answer:**

At Equitable Life, I worked on a complex .NET-based insurance application where documentation was limited and timelines were tight. My responsibility was to ensure full manual test coverage. I created comprehensive test plans, executed system integration and UAT test cases, and trained the QA team on best manual testing practices. I also introduced a traceability matrix to align test cases with business requirements. By staying actively involved in release planning and review sessions, we identified critical issues early, minimized post-release defects, and met our delivery goals.

**STAR Format:**

| Situation | Task | Action | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| At Equitable Life, tasked with testing a complex .NET application with minimal documentation | Ensure full manual test coverage under tight deadlines | Led manual testing phases, trained QA team, created traceability matrices, attended all planning/review meetings | Improved test quality, reduced risk of production defects, and helped ensure on-time delivery |

## Question 3: How do you prioritize tasks when working under tight deadlines?

**Answer:**

At McAfee, I was often responsible for manual testing of complex features with overlapping timelines, especially near major releases. To manage this, I prioritized test cases based on risk level, business impact, and feature dependencies. I communicated daily with developers and product managers to adjust focus areas when needed. I ensured core functionality was tested first and documented all known lower-priority issues for post-release follow-up. This approach consistently helped us meet our release deadlines without compromising quality, and we successfully avoided critical defects in production.

**STAR Format:**

| Situation | Task | Action | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| At McAfee, multiple testing tasks were competing for limited time close to a major release | Ensure all high-risk areas were thoroughly tested while meeting deadlines | Prioritized test cases based on risk, business impact, and critical paths; aligned closely with PMs and Devs to adjust timelines and testing focus | Delivered high-quality testing within the deadline; ensured zero critical issues post-release |
