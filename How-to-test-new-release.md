# How to Test a New Release

## 1. Understand the Release Scope
- Review the **release notes** to identify new features, bug fixes, and changes.
- Gather **requirements and specifications** to understand expected behaviors.
- Identify **impact areas** to focus testing efforts.

## 2. Prepare the Test Environment
- Set up **staging/test environments** that mimic production.
- Deploy the new release to the test environment.
- Ensure all dependencies (databases, APIs, integrations) are available.

## 3. Execute Testing Phases

### A. Smoke Testing
- Perform basic tests to verify the system is stable.
- Example: Ensure the application launches, key buttons work, and major crashes donâ€™t occur.

### B. Functional Testing
- Run **test cases** for new and modified features.
- Validate expected vs. actual results.
- Perform **integration testing** if new features interact with existing ones.

### C. Regression Testing
- Ensure old functionality is not broken due to new changes.
- Run automated/manual test cases from previous versions.

### D. Performance Testing
- Conduct **load testing** to check if the system handles expected user traffic.
- Perform **stress testing** to determine system limits under extreme conditions.

### E. Security Testing
- Identify vulnerabilities through **penetration testing** and **authentication checks**.
- Test user permissions and access controls.

### F. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Have business users validate that the release meets **real-world requirements**.
- Gather feedback for usability and performance.

## 4. Log and Track Issues
- Use tools like **JIRA, Bugzilla, or Azure DevOps** to report bugs.
- Prioritize and categorize issues (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Ensure proper documentation of defects with steps to reproduce.

## 5. Fix, Retest, and Verify
- Developers fix reported bugs.
- Perform **retesting** on fixed issues.
- Conduct **sanity testing** after bug fixes to ensure no new defects were introduced.

## 6. Conduct Final Release Validation
- Perform an **end-to-end system test**.
- Verify deployment scripts, rollback plans, and database migrations.
- Run final **smoke tests** in the production environment (if allowed).

## 7. Approve and Deploy to Production
- Get final **sign-off** from QA, Product, and Business teams.
- Deploy the release using **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Monitor the production system for unexpected issues.

## 8. Post-Release Monitoring
- Track **user feedback and error logs**.
- Monitor application performance (e.g., **CPU, Memory, API response times**).
- Have a rollback plan in case of major failures.
