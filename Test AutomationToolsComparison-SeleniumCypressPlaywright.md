## 3. Feature Comparison Table

| Feature                 | Selenium | Cypress | Playwright |
|-------------------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Ease of Setup**       | Moderate | Easy | Easy |
| **Language Support**    | Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc. | JavaScript, TypeScript | JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C# |
| **Execution Speed**     | Slower (browser driver dependent) | Fast (direct browser control) | Fast (uses WebSocket) |
| **Cross-Browser Support** | Yes (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) | Limited (Chromium, Firefox, Edge) | Yes (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) |
| **Mobile Testing**      | Yes (Appium required) | No | Partial (WebKit for iOS) |
| **Headless Mode**       | Yes | Yes | Yes (optimized) |
| **Parallel Execution**  | Yes (through Grid) | Limited (experimental) | Yes (built-in) |
| **Debugging Tools**     | Limited | Excellent (time-travel, snapshots) | Excellent (trace viewer) |
| **Network Interception & API Mocking** | Limited | Yes | Yes (more advanced than Cypress) |
| **Flakiness Handling**  | Needs explicit waits | Auto-retries flaky tests | Auto-retries flaky tests |
| **Assertions**          | Needs third-party libraries (TestNG, JUnit) | Built-in (Chai, Mocha) | Built-in (Jest-like) |
| **CI/CD Integration**   | Good (needs config) | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Community & Adoption** | Large, well-established | Growing rapidly | Rapidly growing |
| **Best Use Case**       | Traditional web apps, mobile apps (via Appium) | Single-page applications (SPAs), UI-focused tests | Modern web apps, end-to-end automation |

## 4. Detailed Analysis

### 4.1 Selenium
#### ✅ Pros:
- Supports multiple programming languages.
- Can test both web and mobile applications (via Appium).
- Huge community support with extensive documentation.

#### ❌ Cons:
- Slower test execution due to dependency on WebDriver.
- Requires external libraries for assertions, reporting, and parallel execution.

---

### 4.2 Cypress
#### ✅ Pros:
- Fast execution, directly interacts with the browser.
- Automatic wait handling reduces flakiness.
- Built-in support for API testing and network stubbing.
- Excellent debugging tools with a time-travel feature.

#### ❌ Cons:
- Limited browser support (no Safari, limited Firefox).
- Only supports JavaScript/TypeScript.
- No native mobile testing support.

---

### 4.3 Playwright
#### ✅ Pros:
- Modern architecture with fast, reliable tests.
- Supports multiple programming languages.
- Built-in parallel execution.
- Powerful debugging tools (trace viewer).
- Strong API testing and network mocking.

#### ❌ Cons:
- Newer framework, smaller community than Selenium.
- Slightly more complex setup than Cypress.

## 5. Recommendation & Conclusion

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Tool** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Comprehensive cross-browser testing** | Selenium |
| **Fast UI automation with excellent debugging** | Cypress |
| **Modern automation with network mocking & parallel execution** | Playwright |
| **Mobile testing required** | Selenium (via Appium) |
| **Best tool for CI/CD pipeline automation** | Playwright |

### **Summary**
- If you need a **well-established tool with strong cross-language support and mobile testing**, go for **Selenium**.
- If you're working on **modern SPAs with JavaScript/TypeScript** and need a **faster, flake-resistant tool**, **Cypress** is a great choice.
- If you want the **best mix of speed, debugging, and advanced automation features**, **Playwright** is the ideal tool.

## 6. Example Test Cases

### **Selenium (Java)**
```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class TestSelenium {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://example.com");
        System.out.println("Title: " + driver.getTitle());
        driver.quit();
    }
}
