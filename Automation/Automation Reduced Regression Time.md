# How to Calculate Regression Testing Time Reduction %

To calculate the **percentage reduction in regression testing time** due to automation, use the following formula:

```
Reduction % = ((Manual Execution Time - Automated Execution Time) / Manual Execution Time) * 100
```
## Example Calculation

### **Scenario: Automating Regression Testing**
Before automation, regression testing took **40 hours manually**. After automation, it only takes **12 hours**.

### **Formula Application**
The formula to calculate the percentage reduction is:

```
Reduction % = ((Manual Execution Time - Automated Execution Time) / Manual Execution Time) * 100
```

Applying the values:

```
Reduction % = ((40 - 12) / 40) * 100
```

### **Breaking it down:**
```
= (28 / 40) * 100
```

### **Final Value:**
```
= 70% reduction
```

### **Conclusion**
This means **automation reduced regression testing time by 70%**.
